# Song Title: No One Like The Lord

[Verse 1]
There is One on the throne
Jesus, holy

He is worthy of praise
Honor and glory

[Chorus]
Worthy is the Lamb
Who was slain and seated on the throne

No one like the Lord
No one like the Lord

[Bridge]
Holy, holy, holy
Is the Lord God Almighty

Who was and is
And is to come
