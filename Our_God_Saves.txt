In the name of the Father
In the name of the Son
In the name of the Spirit
Lord we come
We're gathered together
To lift up Your name
To call on our Savior
To fall on Your grace
Hear the joyful sound
Of our offering
As Your saints bow down
As Your people sing
We will rise with You
Lifted on Your wings
And the world will see that
Our God saves
Our God saves
There is hope
In Your name
Mourning turns
To songs of praise
Our God saves
Our God saves
